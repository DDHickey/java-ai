# java-ai
A Java AI program that will guess your word using its brain and learned abilities of what letter to guess next.

I wrote this program to practice my skills of simulating a smart computer. The user can add or remove desired words in the words.txt document which the computer will use as a word database to guess from.
Therefore, you can have as little as one word to hundreds of thousands in the document to increase accuracy and efficiency of the machine. 
Currently there are 20,000+ words the computer can guess from as I downloaded a document of many words from the dictionary. Currently the machine doesn't support proper nouns or any commericialized namespaces (i.e. Target, Home Depot, etc).
